# CS-340-Journal

--How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In order to ensure that my code is maintainable and adaptable, I try to make my functions modular. Modular code ensures that the developer can quickly identify a function that needs to be updated, changed, or simply removed from the program. Modular code also helps with the overall readability of the program, especially when coupled with strong naming conventions, proper indentation, and efficient comments. The CRUD Python module developed for CS 340 will provide a great baseline for my future work with this software. 

--How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems one step at a time. First, identify the required functionality, then design base-level functionality and test it. Once all of the functions are developed, I tie everything together and test the combined functionality of the program. 

My approach to this assignment was relatively similar to my prior work; everything was designed in steps and tested. The primary difference was implementing a database and developing the CRUD Python module. This proved hard to debug at times which significantly slowed development time. Now that I have a strong understanding of MongoDB and CRUD Python, I cannot help but think of different ways to use this powerful combination in my day to day. 

--What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists primarily function as problem solvers. We identify the primary problem, design for it, then implement programs that help corporations, small businesses, and people. The work done on this project would enable a company like Grazioso Salvare to operate more efficiently and cost-effectively. This was accomplished by giving Salvare an intuitive program allowing easy data manipulation, searching, and tracking.
